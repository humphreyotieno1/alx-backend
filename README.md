Pagination in Python is a technique used to divide a large set of data into smaller, more manageable chunks called pages. It is commonly used in web applications to display data in a structured and organized manner. The django.core.paginator module provides a convenient way to implement pagination in Django projects. By creating a Paginator object and specifying the number of items per page, you can easily retrieve and display the desired page of data. This allows for efficient navigation through large datasets, improving user experience and reducing server load.
